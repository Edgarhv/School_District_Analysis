Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

The purpose of the **_"PyCitySchools_Challenge.ipynb"_** is to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact because the **_"students_complete.csv"_** file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered.

The associated charts and descriptions for each bulleted list will address the following question.
